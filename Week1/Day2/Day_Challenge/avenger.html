   <h1>DOCTOR STRANGE</h1> 

   <p id="text">Distinguished neurosurgeon Doctor Stephen Strange's self-important worldview was shattered, 
       along with his steady operating hands, in a fateful car accident. Desperate to heal his injuries and 
       pride, Strange sought out a legendary safe known as the Ancient One, becoming a pupil of the mystic arts. 
       Learning that his true worth had always come from within, Strange uncovered his full potential and was 
       chosen to become the Sorcerer Supreme, the world's pre-eminent defender against the darkness that lurks beyond.</p>
